Hi there, I'm Jiachen Xu 👋

I'm currently pursuing an Align MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University's Seattle campus.

My Projects:

🎼 Music Notation Editor: An interactive score editor using OOP principles, enabling gesture-based input, real-time rendering of musical symbols (notes, clefs, key signatures), and dynamic spacing algorithms.

🎮 Combat Game: A turn-based strategy game with custom-designed characters, each with unique skills and cooldown-based abilities.

♦️ Collapse Game: A tile-matching puzzle game featuring recursive tile removal, gravity-based column shifts, and dynamic difficulty scaling.

🧩 Tetris Game: A fully-featured Tetris clone implementing block rotation, collision detection, and line-clearing with score multipliers.
