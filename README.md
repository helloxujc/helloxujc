Hi there, I'm Jiachen Xu 👋

I'm currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University's Seattle campus.

My Projects:

☕ BeanHunter Seattle: Coffee shop review platform with Redis caching (<100ms queries), location-based recommendations, and a flash-sale system handling 1000+ concurrent orders.

🏃‍♀️ RateMyRun: A full-stack web application for discovering, sharing, and reviewing running trails with interactive mapping.

⚔️ BattleGrounds: Turn-based battle game with React + FastAPI, WebSocket real-time sync, and AI opponents. Deployed via Vercel/Render with GitHub Actions CI/CD.
